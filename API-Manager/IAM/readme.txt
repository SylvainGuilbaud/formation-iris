### Step by step instructions
1) Load the IAM image

  1a) Execute the following command to load the IAM image:

    docker load -i iam_image.tar

2) Configure your InterSystems IRIS instance

  2a) Enable the /api/IAM web application
  2b) Enable the IAM user
  2c) Change the password for the IAM user

3) Configure your IAM container

  3a) Navigate to the /scripts directory
  3b) Run the iam-setup script. This script will ask you some questions and set up required environment variables. CAUTION: You have to source the script, otherwise the script can't make the required changes to the environment variables. Execute one of the following commands:

    . ./iam-setup.sh
    source ./iam-setup.sh

4) Start your IAM container

  4a) Navigate to the /scripts directory
  4b) Execute the following command to start IAM:

    docker compose up -d

5) Access your IAM user interface

  5a) You can access the user interface with the following link: http://localhost:8002

6) Test your IAM container

  6a) Navigate to the /scripts directory
  6b) Run the iam-test script. This script sets up a route and a service in IAM and allows you to check connectivity with your InterSystems IRIS instance. If you are running on Ubuntu, make sure to source the script again, otherwise it can't pick up the required environment variables.

7) Stop your IAM container

  7a) Navigate to the /scripts directory
  7b) Execute the following command to stop IAM:
